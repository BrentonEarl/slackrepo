Dependencies are built and installed automatically, according to the
contents of .info files (REQUIRES="...") and hints.  This is done as a 'tree' of
dependencies, not a 'queue', so in some cases dependencies may be
installed and removed multiple times.  Although time consuming, this
is necessary in some cases to produce clean packages for redistribution.

Remember that dependencies on standard Slackware packages are not (and
should not be) listed in .info files and hints, and are not tracked by
slackrepo.
