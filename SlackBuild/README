slackrepo is a tool for making and managing package repositories on
Slackware, by building from repositories of SlackBuilds.

Features:
  - Package updates detected by tracking upstream git revisions
  - Clean repeatable building, including dependencies
  - Highly automated (no interaction required)
  - Output repositories suitable for use with slackpkg+

If you want to build packages as a non-root user, you will need fakeroot
(this is an optional runtime requirement).
