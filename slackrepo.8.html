<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>slackrepo&nbsp;build</B>

<DD>
Builds packages from an input repository of SlackBuilds (for example,
a git clone of SlackBuilds.org), and then stores them in a package repository.
<DT><B>slackrepo&nbsp;rebuild</B>

<DD>
Rebuilds packages that are already in the package repository.
<DT><B>slackrepo&nbsp;remove</B>

<DD>
Removes packages from the package repository.
<DT><B>slackrepo&nbsp;update</B>

<DD>
Builds, rebuilds and removes packages in the package repository,
according to changes in the SlackBuild repository.
<DT><I>ITEM</I>

<DD>
An item specifies
(in build and rebuild mode) a directory in the SlackBuild repository
that contains a set of SlackBuild files,
or (in remove and update mode) a directory in the package repository
that contains one or more packages built from a SlackBuild.
If no items are specified, all directories in the SlackBuild or package
repository are processed (except in remove mode, where it is mandatory
to specify the items to be removed).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--repo=ID</B>

<DD>
Use the SlackBuild and package repository identified by ID.
The filestore locations of the SlackBuild and package repositories are defined in
the configuration file
<I>/etc/slackrepo/slackrepo_ID.conf</I>,

where  ID is an identifier for the repositories.
The default repository ID is SBo.
For details, see
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+slackrepo.conf">slackrepo.conf</A>(5)</B>.

<DT><B>--test</B>

<DD>
The SlackBuild files and the built packages will be subjected to additional
quality assurance tests.
<DT><B>--dry-run</B>

<DD>
Builds and rebuilds will be performed, and removals will be notified, but no
changes will be made to the package repository.
<DT><B>-v</B>, <B>--verbose</B>

<DD>
Increase the quantity of messages printed on the console during execution.
<DT><B>-q</B>, <B>--quiet</B>

<DD>
Reduce the quantity of messages printed on the console during execution.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

The behaviour of
<B>slackrepo</B>

is affected by the following environment variables:

<B>REPO</B>, <B>SBREPO</B>, <B>PKGREPO</B>, <B>SRCREPO</B>,

<B>HINTS</B>, <B>LOGDIR</B>, <B>TMP</B>,

<B>ARCH</B>, <B>TAG</B>, <B>PKGTYPE</B>, <B>NUMJOBS</B>, <B>USE_GENREPOS</B>


Each of these environment variables overrides the corresponding configuration
variable in the file
<I>/etc/slackrepo/slackrepo_ID.conf</I>

or
<I>~/.slackreporc</I>.

For details, see
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+slackrepo.conf">slackrepo.conf</A></B>(5).

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>/etc/slackrepo/slackrepo_SBo.conf</I>

<DD>
This file defines the configuration variables for the SBo repository; see
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+slackrepo.conf">slackrepo.conf</A></B>(5).

<DT><I>~/.slackreporc</I>

<DD>
This file can optionally be created to define the default repository ID
and override configuration variables set in
<I>/etc/slackrepo/slackrepo_ID.conf</I>;

see
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+slackrepo.conf">slackrepo.conf</A></B>(5).

<DT><I>/etc/slackrepo/hints_SBo/</I>

<DD>
This directory contains the hint files for the SBo repository; see
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+slackrepo_hints">slackrepo_hints</A></B>(5).

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>


For best results,
<B>slackrepo</B>

is intended to be run on a &quot;clean&quot; standard Slackware
environment (like a &quot;build box&quot; or a virtual machine), with a full installation
of Slackware and no additional packages (or very few). You can then use the
package repository to install the packages on other hosts (e.g. with
<B>slackpkg+</B>).


Packages are updated or rebuilt if required; for example, if a package is being
built, its dependencies will be updated and/or rebuilt if they are out-of-date.
A package is out-of-date if:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
the git revision in the directory containing the SlackBuild has changed since the package was built
<DT>*<DD>
the directory containing the SlackBuilds has untracked/uncommited files (i.e., &quot;git is dirty&quot;) and they are newer than the package
<DT>*<DD>
any relevant hint has changed since the package was built
<DT>*<DD>
any of its direct dependencies has been updated since the package was built
<DT>*<DD>
the version of Slackware has changed since the package was built
</DL>
</DL>


Changes in the SlackBuilds directory, and changes to the relevant hints, are
classified as &quot;updates&quot;, which will cause directly depending items to be rebuilt.
Other changes are classified as &quot;rebuilds&quot; and do not cause depending items to be rebuilt.
For example, ffmpeg depends on x264, and transcode depends on ffmpeg.
If x264 is updated, ffmpeg will be rebuilt, but transcode will not be rebuilt.
If x264 is rebuilt, ffmpeg will not be rebuilt.
If ffmpeg is updated, transcode will be rebuilt.

When a package is rebuilt, and when a package is updated but its version
is unchanged, the BUILD number in the package repository is always incremented
(and the BUILD number in the SlackBuild file is ignored).

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

Build the whole SBo repository (you will need about four days
and 61Gb of disk space):

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

# slackrepo build

</DL>


Build shotwell, with all its dependencies:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

# slackrepo build shotwell

</DL>


Remove grass (note, its dependencies and dependers will not be removed):

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

# slackpkg remove grass

</DL>


Update all the academic/ packages in your package repository for SBo's latest changes:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

# slackrepo update academic

</DL>


Do a &quot;dry run&quot; update of all your SBo packages, with verbose messages:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

# slackrepo update --dry-run -v

</DL>


Test-build myprog in the newstuff repo, with verbose messages; do not store the built package:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

# slackrepo build -v --repo=newstuff --test --dry-run myprog

</DL>
