Slackrepo runs from the command line.  It is not interactive.  Like other
Slackware package management tools, it should be run as the root user,
for example with 'su -'.  Sources are downloaded on demand (unless already
available in the local cache); a well-functioning network connection is
assumed.

Slackrepo has four modes of operation: build, rebuild, remove, and update.

(1) Build mode:

  `slackrepo build [--options] [item...]`

In build mode, each specified item in the SlackBuild repository is
built and stored into the package repository if there is no up-to-date
package already stored.  Missing or out-of-date dependencies are also
built and stored into the package repository.  If no items are specified,
everything in the SlackBuild repository is built and stored.

Items can be specified as the name of an individual item (e.g. 'wxPython')
or as an individual item in a category (e.g. 'libraries/wxPython'), or as
an entire category of items (e.g. 'libraries').  Obviously, very large
amounts of storage will be needed if you build entire categories.

(2) Rebuild mode:

  `slackrepo rebuild [--options] [item...]`

Rebuild mode is like build mode, except that packages already in the package
repository will be rebuilt, even if they are up-to-date.

(3) Remove mode:

  `slackrepo remove [--options] item...`

In remove mode, each specified item is removed from the package repository.  Also,
any cached source files are removed.

(4) Update mode:

  `slackrepo update [--options] [item...]`

In update mode, each specified package (and its dependencies) in the
package repository is compared to the SlackBuild repository, and built,
rebuilt or removed, as appropriate.  If no items are specified,
everything in the package repository is compared.

### Options

--repo=ID

Use the SlackBuild and package repository identified by ID.  The location of
the SlackBuild and package repositories are determined by the configuration
file /etc/slackrepo/repo_ID.conf.  The default repository ID is SBo.

--test

The SlackBuild files and the built packages will be subjected to additional
quality assurance tests.

--dry-run

Builds and rebuilds will be performed, and removals will be notified, but no changes will be made to the package repository. 

-v, --verbose

Increase the quantity of messages printed on the console during execution.

-q, --quiet

Reduce the quantity of messages printed on the console during execution.
