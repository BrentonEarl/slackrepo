BUGS
----

This is new, experimental software, it hasn't been tested thoroughly yet,
it runs as root so it could trash your entire system.  Please only run it on
systems that you can reinstall or restore from backups easily, eg. a VM.

As new features are added, the man pages will often be out of date.

Don't use the experimental queuefile support.  Currently, enumerating the fake
dependencies causes a factorial explosion in complexity.
