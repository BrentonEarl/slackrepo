BUGS
----

It is possible to have multiple progs named 'x' under different categories,
but there is currently no way of having different hints for each prog.

Log directory is currently one level, so building multiple progs with the same
name will overwrite the same log file.

Inconsistent support for SlackBuilds that create multiple packages.

Embedded spaces in directory names, package names, etc, will cause problems.

A category name or a two-level name could be listed in REQUIRES= (and it would
actually work) but should not pass qa tests.
