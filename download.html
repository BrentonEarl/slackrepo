#5. Do we need to pay or ask for permission to distribute Expect?

It is my understanding that you are allowed to do just about anything
with Expect.  You can even sell it.  You need not ask our permission.
You need not pay for it.  (Your tax dollars, in effect, already have
paid for it.)

You should not claim that you wrote it (since this would be a lie), nor
should you attempt to copyright it (this would be fruitless as it is a
work of the US government and therefore not subject to copyright).

NIST would appreciate any credit you can give for this work.  One line
may suffice (as far as I'm concerned) although there should be
something to the effect that this software was produced for research
purposes.  No warantee, guarantee, or liability is implied.
